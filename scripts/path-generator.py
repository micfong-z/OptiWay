# path-generator.py
# Created by Michael Zhang

# This script generates paths on the same floor on one block
# using data from assets/projection-coords.yaml

# Path types:
# 0: Normal path between two rooms / between a room and one end of a bridge
# 1: Bridge between two buildings
# 2: Normal staircases (e.g. S2-3)
# 3: Spiral staircases between two floors only (e.g. S2-2)
# 4: Other types of staircases (e.g. S4-6)
